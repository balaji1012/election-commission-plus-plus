# Problems in the current voting system:
- Time consuming
- Transparency
- Voting multiple times by the same person in different constituencies
- Possibility of Fraud occurrence ( since there is considerable manual involvement )
- Taking more time to declare results

# Our Idea:
We are coming up with a web application to solve the above problems. This application mainly consists of 3 phases

## Phase1: Registration
- Initially candidates who are eligible for voting need to register.
- Firstly, the website asks for the user’s adhaar number.
- Then he will be directed to a page asking for the basic details(like name, date of birth, phone no or email id), constituency and fingerprint.
- These details will be verified with the data available with government to check the candidate’s identity and also whether the candidate is eligible for voting.
- Once the verification is done successfully, a QR code, which is unique, is generated and the candidate will be eligible for phase 2.
## Phase2: Voting
- We thought of making this phase very less time taking and easily done.
- The candidate who is eligible for this phase have to open the website and just need to upload the QR code which is given.
- Now the candidate will be shown the political parties and their leaders in his constituency.
- The candidate can select a particular party to vote and a confirmation is asked before completing the voting.When the vote is completed, votes of the corresponding leader increases. 
- The candidate will also be provided an option to print the voted slip for proof, if he needs.This completes the voting phase.
## Phase3: Results
- All the local counts will be stored and these sums up for global count.
- Results can be declared(or shown) immediately after the voting deadline is completed.

All these phases may result in increase of percent of people voting, less fraud etc.We are also trying to improvise the above phases to achieve more effective voting process.
